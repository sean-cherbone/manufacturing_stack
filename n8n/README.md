# n8n — Workflow Automation

n8n is an open-source workflow automation platform with a visual node-based editor. It connects APIs, databases, files, and services without writing code, and supports complex branching logic, error handling, sub-workflows, and hundreds of built-in integrations.

## Access

| | |
|---|---|
| **URL** | http://localhost:5678 |
| **Credentials** | Created on first visit — n8n prompts you to set up an owner account |

n8n does not use pre-seeded credentials. The first person to access the UI sets the owner email and password through the setup wizard.

---

## Scripts

### `./start.sh`

On **first run** generates `N8N_ENCRYPTION_KEY` and `RUNNERS_AUTH_TOKEN` and writes them into `.env`, then pulls images and starts all 6 containers. Subsequent runs skip secret generation.

```bash
./start.sh
```

n8n is ready in ~30 seconds. Watch startup:
```bash
docker compose -p n8n logs -f n8n
```

### `./stop.sh`

Stops all containers. Volumes (workflows, credentials, execution history) are preserved.

```bash
./stop.sh
```

### `./teardown.sh`

Interactive full teardown — lists what will be removed, prompts for confirmation, then deletes everything.

```bash
./teardown.sh
```

> **Warning:** Tearing down deletes all workflows, credentials, and execution history. Export your workflows first (see [Back up workflows](#back-up-workflows)).

## Files

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `.env` | All configuration and secrets |
| `docker-compose.yml` | 6-container stack (queue mode with task runners) |
| `init-data.sh` | Runs once at PostgreSQL first start to create the non-root app user |
| `start.sh` | Start / first-run setup |
| `stop.sh` | Stop (volumes preserved) |
| `teardown.sh` | Full wipe with confirmation |

### `.env` — values of interest

| Variable | Value | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `N8N_VERSION` | `stable` | Image tag; pin to a version (e.g. `1.85.0`) for reproducibility |
| `N8N_PORT_HOST` | `5678` | Host port |
| `N8N_ENCRYPTION_KEY` | *(generated)* | Encrypts all stored credentials — **never change** after first start or all saved credentials become unreadable |
| `RUNNERS_AUTH_TOKEN` | *(generated)* | Shared secret between n8n and its external task runner sidecars |
| `WEBHOOK_URL` | `http://localhost:5678/` | The public URL n8n uses in webhook trigger URLs — must match how external services reach this instance |
| `GENERIC_TIMEZONE` | `America/Chicago` | Used by Schedule Trigger nodes — must match your local timezone |
| `N8N_LOG_LEVEL` | `info` | Options: `error`, `warn`, `info`, `verbose`, `debug` |
| `EXECUTIONS_DATA_MAX_AGE` | `336` (14 days) | Hours to keep execution records before pruning |
| `EXECUTIONS_DATA_PRUNE_MAX_COUNT` | `50000` | Maximum execution records to keep |
| `POSTGRES_NON_ROOT_USER` | `n8n_user` | The DB user n8n connects as at runtime |
| `POSTGRES_NON_ROOT_PASSWORD` | `n8n_user_pass` | Its password |

## Architecture

This stack runs n8n in **queue mode** — workflow executions are offloaded to a dedicated worker, keeping the main instance responsive for the UI, webhooks, and scheduling.

```
Browser / Webhooks
  └─► localhost:5678
        └─► n8n  (main instance — UI, API, webhook ingestion, scheduler)
              ├─► n8n-runner     (external task runner sidecar for JS sandboxing)
              ├─► n8n-worker     (pulls execution jobs from Redis queue)
              │     └─► n8n-worker-runner  (task runner sidecar for the worker)
              ├─► n8n_postgres:5432  (PostgreSQL 17 — workflow & credential store)
              └─► n8n_redis:6379     (Redis 6 — BullMQ job queue)
```

**Containers:**

| Container | Image | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `n8n_postgres` | `postgres:17` | Persistent data store (workflows, credentials, executions) |
| `n8n_redis` | `redis:6-alpine` | BullMQ job queue |
| `n8n` | `docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n:stable` | Main instance (UI + API + webhooks + scheduler) |
| `n8n_runner` | `n8nio/runners:stable` | JS task runner sidecar for main instance |
| `n8n_worker` | `docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n:stable` | Execution worker |
| `n8n_worker_runner` | `n8nio/runners:stable` | JS task runner sidecar for worker |

**Volumes:**

| Volume | Contents |
|---|---|
| `db_storage` | PostgreSQL data |
| `redis_storage` | Redis persistence |
| `n8n_storage` | n8n config and internal state (`~/.n8n`) |

## Cheat Sheet

### Logs

```bash
# All services
docker compose -p n8n logs -f

# Main n8n instance (UI, webhooks, scheduler)
docker logs n8n -f

# Worker (execution logs)
docker logs n8n_worker -f

# Task runner
docker logs n8n_runner -f
```

### Shell access

```bash
docker exec -it n8n sh
docker exec -it n8n_postgres psql -U n8n_user -d n8n
```

### Back up workflows

Export all workflows and credentials via the n8n CLI:

```bash
# Export all workflows to a JSON file
docker exec n8n n8n export:workflow --all --output=/home/node/.n8n/workflows.json
docker cp n8n:/home/node/.n8n/workflows.json ./workflows_backup.json

# Export all credentials (encrypted)
docker exec n8n n8n export:credentials --all --output=/home/node/.n8n/credentials.json
docker cp n8n:/home/node/.n8n/credentials.json ./credentials_backup.json
```

Or use the UI: **Settings → Import/Export**

### Restore workflows

```bash
docker cp ./workflows_backup.json n8n:/home/node/.n8n/workflows.json
docker exec n8n n8n import:workflow --input=/home/node/.n8n/workflows.json
```

### Import a workflow from a file

```bash
docker cp my_workflow.json n8n:/tmp/
docker exec n8n n8n import:workflow --input=/tmp/my_workflow.json
```

### Upgrade n8n

1. Update `N8N_VERSION` in `.env` to the target version (e.g. `1.85.0`)
2. `./stop.sh && ./start.sh`
3. n8n runs database migrations automatically on startup

> **Note:** Keep the `N8N_ENCRYPTION_KEY` intact across upgrades — it's needed to decrypt stored credentials.

### Clear stuck executions

```bash
# Remove all 'running' executions left over from a crash
docker exec n8n n8n executionFlushStuck
```

### Reset owner password (if locked out)

n8n 1.x does not have a CLI password reset. Options:

1. Use the "Forgot password" flow (requires SMTP to be configured)
2. Update directly in the database:

```bash
docker exec -it n8n_postgres psql -U n8n_user -d n8n \
  -c "UPDATE \"user\" SET password=NULL WHERE role='global:owner';"
```

Then reload the n8n UI — it will prompt you to set a new password.

## Debugging

### Workflow execution fails silently

- Check the execution log in the UI (click the execution in the left panel)
- Check the worker logs: `docker logs n8n_worker -f`

### Webhook trigger URL not working externally

`WEBHOOK_URL` in `.env` must match the URL external services use to reach n8n. For local-only use `http://localhost:5678/` is correct. For external access (tunnel, VPN), update `WEBHOOK_URL` to the public address and restart.

### Credentials showing as invalid after restart

The `N8N_ENCRYPTION_KEY` changed. Restore the original key from `.env` backup, or re-enter credentials manually.

### Redis queue not draining (worker idle)

```bash
docker logs n8n_worker --tail 30
docker logs n8n_redis --tail 10
```

If the worker is connected but idle, check that the workflow execution mode is `queue` in the n8n settings.

### Check execution data volume

```bash
docker exec n8n_postgres psql -U n8n_user -d n8n \
  -c "SELECT status, COUNT(*) FROM execution_entity GROUP BY status;"
```
