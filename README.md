# Manufacturing Tools Stack

A collection of self-hosted, open-source services for manufacturing operations, deployed locally via Docker Compose. Each service runs as an independent, fully isolated Docker Compose project.

## Services

Idle RAM and base storage are measured with all services running and only an initial admin account created — no workflows, inventory, or projects added.

| Service | Port | Purpose | Idle RAM | Base Storage |
| ------- | ---- | ------- | -------- | ------------ |
| [n8n](https://n8n.io) | [5678](http://localhost:5678) | Workflow automation — integrates all services | ~470 MB | ~70 MB |
| [BookStack](https://www.bookstackapp.com) | [6875](http://localhost:6875) | Documentation and knowledge base | ~240 MB | ~165 MB |
| [FreeScout](https://freescout.net) | [8095](http://localhost:8095) | Help desk and shared inbox | ~330 MB | ~175 MB |
| [Invoice Ninja](https://invoiceninja.com) | [8092](http://localhost:8092) | Accounting and invoicing | ~1.1 GB | ~470 MB |
| [InvenTree](https://inventree.org) | [8096](http://localhost:8096) | Inventory and parts management | ~1.95 GB | ~140 MB |
| [Plane](https://plane.so) | [8100](http://localhost:8100) | Project management and work tracking | ~1.85 GB | ~80 MB |
| [trigger.dev](https://trigger.dev) | [3040](http://localhost:3040) | Background jobs and workflow execution | ~715 MB | ~75 MB |
| **Total** | | | **~6.7 GB** | **~1.2 GB** |

## Total System Requirements

### Resource summary

| Resource | Value |
| -------- | ----- |
| Idle RAM | ~6.7 GB |
| Base volume storage | ~1.2 GB |
| Container images (disk) | ~17 GB |

### Minimum and recommended host resources

| Resource | Minimum | Recommended |
| -------- | ------- | ----------- |
| RAM | 8 GB | 16 GB |
| Disk | 25 GB SSD | 50 GB SSD |
| CPU | 2 cores | 4 cores |

**RAM**: The stack uses ~6.7 GB at idle. An 8 GB host leaves ~1.3 GB for the OS — workable but tight under active use. 16 GB provides comfortable headroom for concurrent users, background job execution, and memory spikes during file uploads or heavy queries.

The largest single consumer is InvenTree at ~1.95 GB. Its background worker (`qcluster`) forks multiple Python processes that each load the full Django application into memory; this is expected behavior and reflects the idle baseline, not a memory leak.

**Disk**: Container images (~17 GB) are a one-time pull per version and do not grow during operation. Volume storage starts at ~1.2 GB with no user data and grows as the stack is used.

### Volume storage growth

| Service | Primary growth drivers |
| ------- | ---------------------- |
| n8n | Workflow execution logs — prune via Settings → Log Pruning or set `EXECUTIONS_DATA_MAX_AGE` in `.env` |
| BookStack | Page content, file attachments, and image uploads |
| FreeScout | Email history and file attachments |
| Invoice Ninja | Invoice PDFs and documents; base includes ~245 MB of static app assets that don't change |
| InvenTree | Parts database, parts images, and document attachments — scales with inventory size |
| Plane | Project data and file uploads — scales with team and issue volume |
| trigger.dev | Job run history — prune via the dashboard or `npx trigger.dev runs delete` |

For storage sizing guidance by database engine:

- [PostgreSQL disk usage](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/diskusage.html) — used by n8n, InvenTree, Plane, trigger.dev
- [MySQL / MariaDB table sizing](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/optimizing-table_size/) — used by BookStack, FreeScout, Invoice Ninja

## Prerequisites

- [Docker Engine 24+](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
- [Docker Compose v2.20+](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
- `openssl` — for automatic secret generation on first start

## Quick Start

```bash
# Start all services
./start-all.sh

# Stop all services
./stop-all.sh
```

Individual service control:

```bash
cd bookstack && ./start.sh
cd bookstack && ./stop.sh

cd n8n && ./start.sh
cd n8n && ./stop.sh

cd freescout && ./start.sh
cd freescout && ./stop.sh

cd invoiceninja && ./start.sh
cd invoiceninja && ./stop.sh

cd inventree && ./start.sh
cd inventree && ./stop.sh

cd plane && ./start.sh
cd plane && ./stop.sh

cd triggerdev && ./start.sh
cd triggerdev && ./stop.sh
```

## Configuration

Each service has a `.env` file containing default values. **Review and update passwords before first run.**

| Service | Config file | Key variables |
| ------- | ----------- | ------------- |
| BookStack | `bookstack/.env` | `DB_PASSWORD`, `MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD` |
| n8n | `n8n/.env` | `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`, `POSTGRES_NON_ROOT_PASSWORD` |
| FreeScout | `freescout/.env` | `DB_PASSWORD`, `ADMIN_EMAIL`, `ADMIN_PASS` |
| Invoice Ninja | `invoiceninja/.env` | `DB_PASSWORD`, `DB_ROOT_PASSWORD`, `IN_USER_EMAIL`, `IN_PASSWORD` |
| InvenTree | `inventree/.env` | `INVENTREE_DB_PASSWORD`, `INVENTREE_ADMIN_PASSWORD` |
| Plane | `plane/.env` | `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`, `SECRET_KEY`, `RABBITMQ_PASSWORD` |
| trigger.dev | `triggerdev/.env` | `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`, `ENCRYPTION_KEY`, `MAGIC_LINK_SECRET`, `SESSION_SECRET` |

`.env` files are git-ignored and will not be committed. Each file is created with working defaults so the stack runs out of the box.

## First Run Notes

### BookStack

- `APP_KEY` is auto-generated and saved to `bookstack/.env` on first start
- Default login: `admin@admin.com` / `password` — change immediately

### n8n

- `N8N_ENCRYPTION_KEY` and `RUNNERS_AUTH_TOKEN` are auto-generated and saved to `n8n/.env` on first start
- Create your owner account on first visit to `http://localhost:5678`
- **Keep `n8n/.env` backed up** — losing `N8N_ENCRYPTION_KEY` means losing access to all stored credentials

### FreeScout

- Database schema and admin account are created automatically on first start (~2–5 minutes)
- Set `ADMIN_EMAIL` and `ADMIN_PASS` in `freescout/.env` before first run — these cannot be changed via `.env` after the database is initialised
- Default login: values of `ADMIN_EMAIL` / `ADMIN_PASS` in `freescout/.env`

### Invoice Ninja

- `APP_KEY`, `DB_PASSWORD`, `DB_ROOT_PASSWORD`, and `IN_PASSWORD` are auto-generated and saved to `invoiceninja/.env` on first start
- Set `IN_USER_EMAIL` in `invoiceninja/.env` before first run to set the admin email
- **Do not change `APP_KEY` after first run** — it encrypts stored credentials and tokens
- Default login: value of `IN_USER_EMAIL` / `IN_PASSWORD` in `invoiceninja/.env`

### InvenTree

- `INVENTREE_DB_PASSWORD` and `INVENTREE_ADMIN_PASSWORD` are auto-generated and saved to `inventree/.env` on first start
- `secret_key.txt` is auto-generated inside the data volume on first start — **back it up and never delete it**, as it encrypts stored credentials
- Database migrations run automatically on startup (`INVENTREE_AUTO_UPDATE=True`)
- Default login: `admin` / value of `INVENTREE_ADMIN_PASSWORD` in `inventree/.env`

### Plane

- `SECRET_KEY`, `LIVE_SERVER_SECRET_KEY`, `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`, `RABBITMQ_PASSWORD`, `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` are auto-generated and saved to `plane/.env` on first start
- Create your workspace and owner account on first visit to `http://localhost:8100`
- **Do not change `SECRET_KEY` after first run** — it invalidates all active sessions

### trigger.dev

- `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`, `MAGIC_LINK_SECRET`, `SESSION_SECRET`, `ENCRYPTION_KEY`, `PROVIDER_SECRET`, and `COORDINATOR_SECRET` are auto-generated and saved to `triggerdev/.env` on first start
- Uses magic link authentication — on first visit enter your email, then retrieve the login link from `docker logs trigger_webapp`
- **Never change `ENCRYPTION_KEY`, `MAGIC_LINK_SECRET`, or `SESSION_SECRET` after first run** — changing these breaks stored data or logs out all users
- The `docker-provider` and `coordinator` containers mount `/var/run/docker.sock` to spawn task worker containers on demand

## Data Persistence

All service data is stored in Docker named volumes scoped to each project. Stopping services preserves all data.

To remove a service's data volumes (destructive — cannot be undone):

```bash
cd <service> && ./stop.sh --volumes
```

To remove all data across all services:

```bash
./stop-all.sh --volumes
```

## Architecture Notes

Each service is a separate Docker Compose project with its own network, volumes, and container namespace. They share only the host network interface (via distinct ports) and have no cross-service Docker networking by default.

| Service | Docker project | Database |
| ------- | ------------- | -------- |
| BookStack | `bookstack` | MariaDB 11 |
| n8n | `n8n` | PostgreSQL 17 |
| FreeScout | `freescout` | MariaDB 11 |
| Invoice Ninja | `invoiceninja` | MySQL 8 |
| InvenTree | `inventree` | PostgreSQL 17 |
| Plane | `plane` | PostgreSQL 15 |
| trigger.dev | `triggerdev` | PostgreSQL 16 |
